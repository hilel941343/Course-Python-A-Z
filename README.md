# 🐍 Course: Python A-Z (קורס פייתון מא' ועד ת')
This project is a comprehensive learning journey through the fundamentals of Python programming, based on the Hebrew-language course (https://youtu.be/MAdr67RNrMg?si=rxRBn1hZCzfFuB0r) on YouTube. 
The course covers a wide range of essential Python topics, each presented in a clear, focused manner to build a solid foundation in programming.

# 📘 What I Did in This Project
Throughout this project, I followed the lessons step by step, implementing and experimenting with the concepts covered in each video. The topics I worked on include:

✅ Variables and Data Types

✅ Control Flow: if-else, loops (for, while)

✅ Functions and Scope

✅ Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets

✅ String Manipulation

✅ File Handling (read/write)

✅ Exception Handling

✅ Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance)

✅ Modules and Packages

✅ Working with External Libraries

✅ Basics of GUI with Tkinter (if included in the course)

I enriched the exercises with personal notes and examples to deepen my understanding, and organized the code in a clear structure for easy navigation and future reference.
